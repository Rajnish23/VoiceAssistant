Project Goal was to develope an application that aimed to solve and simplify day to day complication faced by normal person who don't know how to use smartphone.

The original Idea came from the problem that I faced with my parents. I am working in kuwait and I can only talk to my parent through whatsapp only. One day I hide the DP of Whatsapp and when I call my mother she was saying that she cannot see my photo and though she was not able to make a call.

That day I got an Idea to make an app where anyone with such problem can give a command and it will take action based on command given by user.

## List of Commands
<ol>
   <li> For WELCOME -  नमस्ते, नमस्कार, सुप्रभात</li>
   <li> For CALL (Normal) - मैं किसी को कॉल करना चाहता हूं, कॉल करें, फोन लगाये</li>
   <li> For WHATSAPP_CALL - व्हाट्सएप कॉल करें, व्हाट्सएप फोन लगाये</li>
   <li> For SAVE Contact - नंबर जोड़ें, नंबर सेव करें</li>
   <li> After both call and save command it will ask for name For that नाम है (Name)</li>
   <li> For TIME - समय, समय क्या है, समय बताओ </li>
</ol>
